## Product Requirements Document: Book Store Management (MVP)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** August 24, 2025
**Author:** Khusroo (Senior Technical Product Manager)

### 1. Overview & Vision

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Book Store Web App. This application will provide a simple, clean, and efficient interface for managing a book inventory. It will be built on the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack, featuring a robust backend API and a functional frontend.

The vision for this MVP is to deliver a foundational inventory management tool with user authentication and authorization. It will replace the need for cumbersome spreadsheets or manual tracking by providing core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for a book collection in a streamlined web-based experience. The app now supports multiple users, each with their own secure account and access to their personal inventory.

### 2. The Problem

Small bookstore owners, librarians, or personal collectors often rely on inefficient methods like spreadsheets or physical notebooks to manage their inventory. This approach is prone to errors, difficult to maintain, and lacks a user-friendly interface for quick updates and viewing. There is a need for a straightforward, no-frills digital solution to perform the most essential inventory management tasks.

This project solves the problem by providing a dedicated web application for simple book management, powered by a well-defined API.

### 3. Target Audience

For the MVP, we are focusing on the following primary user personas:

*   **The Store Manager / Collector:**
    *   **Profile:** An individual responsible for maintaining and managing a collection of books. They need a simple tool to add new books, update existing entries, view their collection, and remove books that are no longer available.
    *   **Needs:** A fast, intuitive interface that allows them to perform all core inventory tasks without a steep learning curve or unnecessary complexity.
*   **Authenticated Users:**
    *   **Profile:** Any user who registers and logs in to the system. Each user has secure access to their own book inventory and data.
    *   **Needs:** Secure authentication, privacy of data, and personalized access to inventory management features.

### 4. Goals & Success Metrics (MVP)

**Goals:**

1.  **Deliver Core CRUD Functionality:** Successfully implement all features required to create, read, update, and delete books in the inventory.
2.  **Implement User Authentication & Authorization:** Provide secure registration, login, and session management so users can access their own inventory.
3.  **Provide a Functional User Interface:** Build a clean and responsive web front-end that allows a user to easily interact with the backend API.
4.  **Ensure API Robustness:** The backend API must be stable, handle errors gracefully, and provide clear validation feedback.

**Success Metrics:**

*   **Functionality:** All specified user stories are implemented and functional in a production-like environment.
*   **API Performance:** Average API response time is under 200ms for all endpoints under normal load.
*   **Deployment:** The full-stack application (frontend and backend) is successfully deployed and accessible via a public URL.

### 5. User Stories & Functional Requirements

This section details the features for both the backend API and the frontend Web App.


#### 5.0. Authentication & Authorization

        *   An HTTP `GET` endpoint (e.g., `/api/books`) is available.
        *   It supports pagination via query parameters (e.g., `?page=1&limit=10`).
        *   It returns a `200 OK` status with a paginated list of books.
*   **AS A STORE MANAGER, I need an API endpoint to view the details of a single book, SO THAT I can inspect a specific item.**
    *   **Requirement ID:** FR003
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   An HTTP `GET` endpoint with a unique identifier (e.g., `/api/books/:id`) is available.
        *   If the book is found, it returns a `200 OK` status with the book's full details.
        *   If the book is not found, it returns a `404 Not Found` error.
*   **AS A STORE MANAGER, I need an API endpoint to update a book's information, SO THAT I can keep my inventory details accurate.**
    *   **Requirement ID:** FR004
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   An HTTP `PUT` or `PATCH` endpoint (e.g., `/api/books/:id`) is available.
        *   It accepts a JSON payload with the fields to be updated.
        *   It returns a `200 OK` status with the updated book object.
*   **AS A STORE MANAGER, I need an API endpoint to delete a book, SO THAT I can remove items no longer in my collection.**
    *   **Requirement ID:** FR005
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   An HTTP `DELETE` endpoint (e.g., `/api/books/:id`) is available.
        *   On successful deletion, it returns a `204 No Content` or `200 OK` status.
*   **AS A DEVELOPER, I want the API to perform input validation and provide clear error messages, SO THAT the data integrity is maintained and the frontend can react accordingly.**
    *   **Requirement ID:** FR007, FR008
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Requests with missing required fields (e.g., `title`) are rejected with a `400 Bad Request` status and a meaningful error message.
        *   Requests for non-existent resources return a `404 Not Found` error.
        *   Server-side errors result in a `500 Internal Server Error` response.
*   **AS A DEVELOPER, I want to keep database credentials secure, SO THAT sensitive information is protected.**
    *   **Requirement ID:** FR009
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   MongoDB connection strings and other secrets are managed through environment variables (`.env` file).
        *   The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and is not committed to version control.

#### 5.2. Frontend Web App (Angular)

*   **AS A STORE MANAGER, I WANT to see a list of all my books when I open the app, SO THAT I can get an immediate overview of my inventory.**
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The main page fetches and displays a list of books from the `GET /api/books` endpoint.
        *   The list is displayed in a clean table or grid format, showing key details like title and author.
        *   Pagination controls are present if the API returns more than one page of results.
*   **AS A STORE MANAGER, I WANT a dedicated "Add Book" button and form, SO THAT I can easily add new items to my collection.**
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A clear CTA (e.g., a button or link) navigates to a new page or opens a modal with a form for adding a book.
        *   The form includes input fields for all required book details.
        *   Submitting the form calls the `POST /api/books` endpoint and displays a success message.
        *   The user is redirected back to the main book list, which now includes the new book.
*   **AS A STORE MANAGER, I WANT to edit the details of an existing book, SO THAT I can correct errors or update information.**
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Each book in the list has an "Edit" button.
        *   Clicking "Edit" navigates to a form that is pre-populated with the book's current data.
        *   Submitting the form calls the `PUT /api/books/:id` endpoint and redirects the user back to the updated list.
*   **AS A STORE MANAGER, I WANT to delete a book from the list, SO THAT I can remove items that are no longer in stock.**
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Each book in the list has a "Delete" button.
        *   Clicking "Delete" prompts the user with a confirmation dialog (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this book?").
        *   On confirmation, the app calls the `DELETE /api/books/:id` endpoint and removes the book from the list in the UI.

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Usability:** The web interface must be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate for a non-technical user.
*   **Responsiveness:** The web app should be responsive and functional on modern desktop browsers. Mobile optimization is a secondary goal for the MVP.
*   **Security:** The application must not store sensitive credentials in the frontend code. Communication between the frontend and backend should be secure (HTTPS in production).

### 7. Technical Stack

*   **Frontend:** Angular
*   **Backend Server:** Node.js with Express.js framework
*   **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose for object data modeling)
*   **Deployment:** A PaaS provider like Heroku, Vercel, or a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP).

### 8. Out of Scope (MVP)

To ensure a focused and timely delivery of the MVP, the following features are explicitly **out of scope**:
*   Search and filtering functionality.
*   Uploading book cover images.
*   E-commerce features (e.g., shopping cart, pricing, orders).
*   User reviews or rating systems.
*   Multi-language support.
