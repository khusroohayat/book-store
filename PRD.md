|----------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Add a New Book                     | As a user, I want to add a new book to the store so that it is available for others to view.    | The system should provide an endpoint to create a new book with details like title, author, and other relevant fields.     |
| FR002          | View All Books                     | As a user, I want to view a list of all books in the store so I can browse available options.   | The system should provide an endpoint to retrieve a paginated list of all books.                                           |
| FR003          | View a Single Book                 | As a user, I want to view details of a specific book so I can learn more about it.              | The system should provide an endpoint to retrieve details of a book by its unique identifier.                              |
| FR004          | Update Book Information            | As a user, I want to update the information of a book so that details remain accurate.          | The system should provide an endpoint to update one or more fields of a book by its unique identifier.                     |
| FR005          | Delete a Book                      | As a user, I want to remove a book from the store if it is no longer available.                 | The system should provide an endpoint to delete a book by its unique identifier.                                           |
| FR006          | Pagination for Book Listings       | As a user, I want to view books in pages so that the list is manageable and loads quickly.      | The system should support pagination parameters (e.g., page number, page size) on the list books endpoint.                 |
| FR007          | Input Validation                   | As a user, I want to be notified if I provide invalid data so I can correct my input.           | The system should validate input data and return appropriate error messages for invalid or missing fields.                  |
| FR008          | Error Handling                     | As a user, I want clear error messages if something goes wrong so I understand the issue.        | The system should return meaningful error responses for invalid requests, server errors, or not found resources.            |
| FR009          | Secure Database Credentials        | As a developer, I want to keep database credentials secure so that sensitive information is protected. | The system should use environment variables for sensitive configuration and ensure `.env` is not committed to version control. |
